# writing tasks 
- [ ] summarize completness 
  - several results sections unwritten, but demphasized
  - (?) 3 main chunks of methods writing to do?
  - [ ] check methods figures
  - [ ] quarantine speculative methods
- [ ] write methods overview 
  - find a good example of this
- [ ] write methods sections

---- 
# Mostly complete
- [x] reading through [10 simple rules for structuring papers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088278v5.full.pdf+html)
  
  - [x] transcribe followup tasks
    - [ ] what's the one idea we're communicating
    - [ ] check context-content-conclusion structure
    - [ ] diagram out threads of logic ‚Üí should be as serial as possible
      - avoid "why was i told that?" (missing context) and "so what?" (missing conclusion)
        - ask yourself these questions to emulate a naive reader
        
      - in intro, check for
        - Ans: why does the paper matter? 
        - connection to big problem in science
        - statement of what the field knows 
        - refinement to narrow paper gap
        - summary of our approach, our results
          - shouldn't restate context 
          - shouldn't preview conclusion (much)
      - in results check for 
        - METHODS SUMMARY (high-level): FIRST, what question are we trying to answer
          - then OVERVIEW of methods (pipeline summary)
          - basic components
          - answer we're looking for
          - overall approach
          - key innovative methods
          - assume readers aren't going to pore over the details
          
        - RESULTS:
          - [ ] what are the sequence of statements we're trying to prove? ‚Üí turn these into headers
            - support these steps with figures
            - connect these steps to final conclusion
          - [ ] verify paragraphs start with "to verify that..." "we tested whether..."
          - [ ] verify paragraphs end with answer to question
          - [ ] verify each title states a conclusion
          - [ ] verify each legend tells how the trick was done
          - ( ) use my highlight color-code to check for context-content-conclusion?

          - need to show
          - how? by doing x
          - thus we know
          - FLOW 
            - raw data 
            - processed data 
            - metrics 
            - final summary statistics

            
- [x] read the abstract
  - looks good, will need revisiting after scope of results, conclusions is finalized

# Low priority / archived:
## intro / methods tasks
  
 - [ ] add more closed-loop references to intro[^ctrl_sys_id]
 - [ ] Describe the methods for identifying circuits[^FC_measures][^connect_infer]
  - xcorr procedure 
  - IDTxl recap 
    - cover multivariate transfer entropy 
 - evaluate dimensions of parameter sweeps[^FC_measures]
 - sketch a short review of closed-loop in neuro
  - Grosenick/Deisseroth, Kording 
  
 - [~] write up "tutorial" + latex for different ways of representing a circuit

 [^FC_measures]: "A systematic framework for functional connectivity measures" includes a broad comparison of performance of Granger causality vs transfer entropy vs other methods. also discusses role of weights, noise
 [^connect_infer]: "Connectivity inference from neural recording data: Challenges, mathematical bases and research directions"
 [^ctrl_sys_id]: "A control-theoretic system identification framework and a real-time closed-loop clinical simulation testbed for electrical brain stimulation"

## theory 
- [x] write python to compute via reachability 
- [x] write input ‚Üí connection notation 
- [~] evaluate python on simple circuit
  - see [code/network_analysis/simple_gaussian_SNR.py](code/network_analysis/simple_gaussian_SNR.py)  

- [~] üéÅ relate noise ‚Üí connection SNR to sensitivity transfer function 
  - see [Astrom feedback fundamentals](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/courses/cds101/fa02/caltech/astrom-ch5.pdf)
- [?] copy over notation from 2020 brainstorming [overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e8232cd6157d200014b52d4)
  - rules for identifiability 
- [ ] üéÅ discuss the role of prior anatomical knowledge in reducing search space 



## formatting tasks 
- add figure references to table of contents  

## organization tasks
- move exemplars to sketches/intro-background ?

- possible journals 
  - connect with Lepperod/Kording?
  - perspectives 
    - Nature Neuro
  - technical
    - Neuron
