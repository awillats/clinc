Our goal is to develop clean answers, phrased in neuro terms, to the following questions:
- Given a pair of neural circuits, is it possible to disambiguate them using observational data, or is open- or closed-loop control needed?  If control is needed, where should it be applied?
- Given a fixed control budget and some kind of ranking of potential causal links we'd like to uncover, where should control be applied, and how much inference power do we have?
- How do these answers change in the face of **imperfect** control (for example, when other observed or unobserved variables still have some limited effect on the circuit)?
