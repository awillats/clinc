# Organization
*see [README.md](/README.md) for more, high-level overview*

most analysis files with many functions will also have an 
```python 
if __name__ == "__main__":
  use_functions()
```
section at the bottom which executes if you call the file as a script (but not if you simply import it). This section is intended as a soft test of basic functionality, but also a demonstration of how to use functions.


most commonly the following functions are imported with aliases like so:
```python
#external libraries
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
#data
import network_data_functions as net_data
import example_circuits as egcirc
#sim
import sim_simple_network_functions as sim
#analysis
import network_analysis_functions as net
import network_plotting_functions as netplot
#plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotting_functions as myplot
```

## network_analysis/

- `simulation_functions/`  :star:
  <!-- - <details><summary>sim_simple_network_functions.py</summary> -->
  -sim_simple_network_functions
    - takes a circuit specification and generates output data
      - generates various forms of random noise
      - uses several ways of "realizing" network dynamics 
        - `sim_contemporaneous`
        $$X^-:=E+Bu  \\X := X^-\bar{W} + X^- = X^-\widetilde{W}$$
          - matrix computation (faster)
          - for-loop computation (more flexible)
        - `sim_dynamic`
        $$X_{t+1} := X_t W + E + Bu$$

## MATLAB/
Some early prototype code for computing reachability and correlation was written in MATLAB ... 

## _plotting/
eventually plotting functions will get moved here ...
