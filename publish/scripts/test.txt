A range of mathematical and practical challenges make it difficult to
determine these causal relationships. In studies that rely only
observational data, it is often impossible to determine whether observed
patterns of activity are caused by known and controlled inputs, or
whether they are instead spurious connections generated by recurrent
activity, indirect relationships, or unobserved "confounders." It is
generally understood that moving from experiments involving passive
observation to more complex levels of intervention allows experimenters
to better tackle challenges to circuit identification. However, while
chemical and surgical lesion experiments have historically been employed
to remove the influence of possible confounds, they are likely to
dramatically disrupt circuits from their typical functions, making
conclusions about underlying causal structure drawn from these
experiments unlikely to hold in naturalistic settings
