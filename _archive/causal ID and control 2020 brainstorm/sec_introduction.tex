Our goal is to develop clean answers, phrased in neuro terms, to the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a pair of neural circuits, is it possible to disambiguate them using observational data, or is open- or closed-loop control needed?  If control is needed, where should it be applied?
    \item Given a fixed control budget and some kind of ranking of potential causal links we'd like to uncover, where should control be applied, and how much inference power do we have?
    \item How do these answers change in the face of \emph{imperfect} control (for example, when other observed or unobserved variables still have some limited effect on the circuit)?
\end{enumerate}
