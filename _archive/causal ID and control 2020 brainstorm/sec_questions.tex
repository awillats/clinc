\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adam postulates: closed-loop control can act to add a "virtual stimulation" point at an edge where otherwise only recordings are available. This results in off-target / collateral stimulation, but could still allow adding a "open-loop stimulation node" where one could not be physically injected. I think this is worth evaluating as a low-priority theory target
    \item How does "indirect control" (i.e. closed-loop control involving stimulation of one region, and recording from a second, downstream region) fit into this theoretical framework?
