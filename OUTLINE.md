- Interventions in neuro 
  - lesion studies in neuro
    - disadvantages of lesioning
  
- What is closed-loop control?
    - Responsive and per-sample feedback control in neuro
    - Comparison to standard neuro system identification procedures (stim, lesions)
    - Stanley, Rozell prior work in closed-loop opto

- **Causal methods for network discovery from time-series**
  - What challenges are faced when estimating network connectivity?
    - [...]
  - background building from granger causality towards more complex methods
    - highlight limitations with current approaches
  - *cite J.Runge*
  
- Interventions from the perspective of causal inference
  - core idea is that "stronger" interventions lead to "higher inferential power"
    - may mean identifying circuits with less data 
    - but may also mean distinguishing circuits which may have been "observationally equivalent" under weaker interventions

# Methods 
## Multiple complementary perspectives (represenations) of the same underlying network structure:
- The circuit view
  - (A) ‚Üí (B) ‚Üî (C)
- The dynamical system view

\[
\begin{cases}{x' = Ax + Bu}\\
y=Cx+\eta
\end{cases}
\]

- The connectivity (adjacency matrix) view
\[
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_A \\ \dot{x}_B \\ \dot{x}_C \end{bmatrix}}_{\dot{x}} =
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    w_{AA} & w_{AB} & w_{AC} \\
    w_{BA} & w_{BB} & w_{BC} \\
    w_{CA} & w_{CB} & w_{CC}
\end{bmatrix}}_{A}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    x_A \\
    x_B \\
    x_C
\end{bmatrix}}_{x}
\]
- why consider multiple 

## Interventions in causal identification
- intervention types 
  - passive observation 
  - open-loop stimulation 
    - simulated as direct current injection
    - but uniform across a population 
    - ( see [Kyle Johnsen's cleosim toolbox](https://cleosim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more detailed simulation of stimulation )
  - closed-loop stimulation
    - approaches for control 
      - going with "model-free" PID control of output rates
    - comparison to randomization in traditional experiment design
  
## Reachability
- concept of **binary reachability** as a "best case scenario" for identification.
  - binary reachability describes which pairs of nodes we expect to have any correlation
  - can be used to predict "equivalence classes", i.e. circuits which may be indistinguishable under certain interventions
  - how binary reachability is computed 
    - [...equations here...]
- **graded reachability** can help predict the influence of parameter values (e.g. edge weights, time-constants) on identifiability
  - quantifies impact of inputs, noise on outputs
  - easiest to describe/understand in linear-gaussian setting
  - [...equations here...]

## Understanding identification through derived properties of circuits (reachability rules)
- connect **binary reachability** to classes of ambiguity 
  - a pair of networks are ambiguous (given some intervention) if they are in the same markov equivalence class 
  - ambiguity x intervention leads to the following classes 
    - passively unambiguous
    - open-loop unambiguous 
    - (single-site) closed-loop unambiguous
    - 
- connect **graded reachability** to ID-SNR 
  - $\mathrm{IDSNR}_{ij}$ measures the strength of signal related to the connection $i‚Üíj$ relative to in the output of node $j$ 
  - for true, direct connections this quantity increasing means a (true positive) connection will be identified more easily (with high certainty, requiring less data)
  - for false or indirect connections, this quantity increasing means a false positive connection is more likely to be identified
  - as a result we want to maximize IDSNR for true links, and minimize it for false/indirect links

# Results 
<a name='figure-demo'></a>
üèûÔ∏è
## Figure DEMO: Applying CLINC to distinguish a pair of circuits (case-study)
  - explanation using binary reachability rules
    - consider postponing until we introduce intervention? 
    - i.e. have one figure that walks through both reachability and impact of intervention
  - *(e.g. Advancing functional connectivity research from association to causation, Combining multiple functional connectivity methods to improve causal inferences)*

<a name='figure-binary'></a>
## [Binary Sim.] - Characterizing circuit-pair ambiguity through binary reachability properties
  - proportion of each ambiguity class as a function of circuit size
  - possibly weight proportions by observed frequency of triplet motifs
‚úÇÔ∏èÔ∏è **Figure:** ambiguity class by circuit size‚úÇÔ∏è üèûÔ∏è
    - SCOPE: cut?
    
## Characterization of network estimation performance 

### Extracting circuit estimates 
- *(see methods for xcorr, muTE)*

### Quantifying successful identification
- binary "classification" metrics
  - accuracy, F1 score (Wang & Shanechi 2019)
  - AUC (Pastore)
  - Jaccard index (Lepage, Ching, and Kramer 2013)
  - true/false positives, true/false negatives 
- graded metrics (*not a core focus here*)
  - distance between identified connection strength and ground-truth
    - MSE [(Lepperod et al. 2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/463760v2)
  - error in output reconstruction
- *relevant "negative control" for comparison (?)*
  - identified connectivity for random network?
  - some shuffled data-surrogate procedure?
- *relevant "positive control" for comparison (?)*


### *Impact of node, network parameters*

- **gaussian network simulation**

  <details><summary> ‚Ü™Ô∏è click to expand </summary>
  
  - **parameters**
    - synaptic (edge) weights - $w$
    - synaptic (edge) delay - $\delta$
    - time-constants - $\tau$
    - node noise - $\sigma$
  - **expected results**
    - weight increases xcorr peaks
    - $\tau$ blurs xcorr peak in time 
    - delay $\delta$ increases time-separability of sources 
      - at $\delta = 0$ limit, connections are harder to distinguish
        - especially direct v.s. indirect
    - noise $\sigma$ has a "location specific" impact describe by IDSNR transfer function 
      - generally, high noise "upstream" of a connection increases the strength of a hypothesized connection 
        - as long as any path is present between $i‚Üí‚Üíj$
      - high noise "downstream" of a connection, but impinging on the output node competes with / blurs / corrupts  
      - **The location-dependent impact of noise on connection identifiability may be one key way in which different forms of intervention impact circuit estimates**
  </details>
  
- **spiking network simulation**
  - all gaussian params, plus ...
  - spiking nonlinearity

### Figure DATA: Analysis of simulated circuits suggest stronger intervention facilitates identification with less data 
  - *metric:* \# of samples required to reach accuracy threshold
  - closed-loop > open-loop > passive 


<a name='figure-predict'></a>
üèûÔ∏è
### Figure PREDICT: Comparing predicted and emprical identification performance
  - layout: scatterplot and curve fit of emprical vs predicted accuracy (false positives, false negatives)
    - segmented by circuit type?
  - could be part of figures above 
  
<a name='figure-disambig'></a>
üèûÔ∏è
### Figure DISAMBIG: Stronger intervention facilitates disambiguating equivalent hypotheses
  - SCOPE: can this be combined with case-study walkthrough?
  - like a quantitative version of [binary proportion figure](#figure-binary)
  - in example: shows a dataset with many correlations, multiple plausible circuit hypotheses 
    - patterns of correlation become more specific with increasing intervention strength 
  - in aggregate: focuses on reduced bias, higher accuracy for "infinite" data limit
  - closed-loop > open-loop > passive

# Discussion 
- Comparison to related work
  - comparison to work in ANNs 
    - Kording, fakhar 
  - comparison to Shanechi
  - comparison to Bassett "network controllability" view

- Limitations of evaluated interventions 
  - quantifying the impact of imperfect / realistic control 
  - barriers such as low spatial / temporal precision may prevent high-performing control
  
- Limitations of network extraction approach
  - limitations of bivariate xcorr 
  - effect of design / hyperparameters
    - nonlinear TE estimators
    - time bin size
  - extraction from spiking, firing rates, LFP
  
- Limitations of **network simulation**
  - small number of nodes
  - simple neuron dynamics 
  - didn't focus on intricate connectivity that has been observed 
    - future work - apply to more complex Brian2 network models
  - assumed measurement from entire network
  - homogeneity in network parameters
  - understanding mediating effect of spike counts

- **Recommendations for designing network discovery experiments**
  - At the experiment-design phase, analyze competing hypotheses
    - through the lens of CLINC reachability / IDSNR 
    - evaluate what can be distinguished under different interventions 
  
  - A spectrum of interventions - pick the right tool for the job
    - stronger interventions generally come with cost 
      - increased experiment complexity 
    - depending on challenges, similarity of hypothesized circuits...
      - passive observation may be enough
      - or stronger interventions may be required 
  
- Future work
  - tighter integration of knowledge of intervention into network estimation procedure 
    - stimulus-conditional transfer entropy
