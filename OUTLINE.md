- Interventions from the perspective of causal inference
  - core idea is that "stronger" interventions lead to "higher inferential power"
    - may mean identifying circuits with less data 
    - but may also mean distinguishing circuits which may have been "observationally equivalent" under weaker interventions

# Methods 
## Multiple complementary perspectives (represenations) of the same underlying network structure:
- The circuit view
  - (A) ‚Üí (B) ‚Üî (C)
- The dynamical system view

\[
\begin{cases}{x' = Ax + Bu}\\
y=Cx+\eta
\end{cases}
\]

- The connectivity (adjacency matrix) view
\[
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_A \\ \dot{x}_B \\ \dot{x}_C \end{bmatrix}}_{\dot{x}} =
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    w_{AA} & w_{AB} & w_{AC} \\
    w_{BA} & w_{BB} & w_{BC} \\
    w_{CA} & w_{CB} & w_{CC}
\end{bmatrix}}_{A}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    x_A \\
    x_B \\
    x_C
\end{bmatrix}}_{x}

## Interventions in causal identification
- intervention types 
  - passive observation 
  - open-loop stimulation 
    - simulated as direct current injection
    - but uniform across a population 
    - ( see [Kyle Johnsen's cleosim toolbox](https://cleosim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more detailed simulation of stimulation )
  - closed-loop stimulation
    - approaches for control 
      - going with "model-free" PID control of output rates
    - comparison to randomization in traditional experiment design
  
## Reachability
- concept of **binary reachability** as a "best case scenario" for identification.
  - binary reachability describes which pairs of nodes we expect to have any correlation
  - can be used to predict "equivalence classes", i.e. circuits which may be indistinguishable under certain interventions
  - how binary reachability is computed 
    - [...equations here...]
- **graded reachability** can help predict the influence of parameter values (e.g. edge weights, time-constants) on identifiability
  - quantifies impact of inputs, noise on outputs
  - easiest to describe/understand in linear-gaussian setting
  - [...equations here...]

## Understanding identification through derived properties of circuits (reachability rules)
- connect **binary reachability** to classes of ambiguity 
  - a pair of networks are ambiguous (given some intervention) if they are in the same markov equivalence class 
  - ambiguity x intervention leads to the following classes 
    - passively unambiguous
    - open-loop unambiguous 
    - (single-site) closed-loop unambiguous
    - 
- connect **graded reachability** to ID-SNR 
  - $\mathrm{IDSNR}_{ij}$ measures the strength of signal related to the connection $i‚Üíj$ relative to in the output of node $j$ 
  - for true, direct connections this quantity increasing means a (true positive) connection will be identified more easily (with high certainty, requiring less data)
  - for false or indirect connections, this quantity increasing means a false positive connection is more likely to be identified
  - as a result we want to maximize IDSNR for true links, and minimize it for false/indirect links 

## Network simulations 
- built on [Brian2](https://elifesciences.org/articles/47314) spiking neural network simulator

### Extracting circuit estimates 
- *(see methods for xcorr, muTE)*

### Quantifying successful identification
- binary "classification" metrics
  - accuracy
  - F1 score 
  - true/false positives, true/false negatives 
- graded metrics (*not a core focus here*)
  - distance between identified connection strength and ground-truth
- *relevant "negative control" for comparison (?)*
  - identified connectivity for random network?
  - some shuffled data-surrogate procedure?
- *relevant "positive control" for comparison (?)*


### *Impact of node, network parameters*
- **gaussian network simulation**
  <details><summary> ‚Ü™Ô∏è click to expand </summary>
  - **parameters**
    - synaptic (edge) weights - $w$
    - synaptic (edge) delay - $\delta$
    - time-constants - $\tau$
    - node noise - $\sigma$
  - **expected results**
    - weight increases xcorr peaks
    - $\tau$ blurs xcorr peak in time 
    - delay $\delta$ increases time-separability of sources 
      - at $\delta = 0$ limit, connections are harder to distinguish
        - especially direct v.s. indirect
    - noise $\sigma$ has a "location specific" impact describe by IDSNR transfer function 
      - generally, high noise "upstream" of a connection increases the strength of a hypothesized connection 
        - as long as any path is present between $i‚Üí‚Üíj$
      - high noise "downstream" of a connection, but impinging on the output node competes with / blurs / corrupts  
      - **The location-dependent impact of noise on connection identifiability may be one key way in which different forms of intervention impact circuit estimates**

- üèûÔ∏è **Figure:** Stronger intervention facilitates disambiguating equivalent hypotheses üèûÔ∏è
  - in example: shows a dataset with many correlations, multiple plausible circuit hypotheses 
    - patterns of correlation become more specific with increasing intervention strength 
  - in aggregate: focuses on accuracy
  - closed-loop > open-loop > passive

- **Recommendations for designing network discovery experiments**
  - At the experiment-design phase, analyze competing hypotheses
    - through the lens of CLINC reachability / IDSNR 
    - evaluate what can be distinguished under different interventions 
  
  - A spectrum of interventions - pick the right tool for the job
    - stronger interventions generally come with cost 
      - increased experiment complexity 
    - depending on challenges, similarity of hypothesized circuits...
      - passive observation may be enough
      - or stronger interventions may be required 
  
- Future work
  - tighter integration of knowledge of intervention into network estimation procedure 
    - stimulus-conditional transfer entropy
