# Introduction
- What is closed-loop control?
    - Responsive and per-sample feedback control in neuro
    - Comparison to standard neuro system identification procedures
- Interventions from the perspective of causal inference

# Methods
## Multiple complementary perspectives on the same underlying network structure:
 - The circuit view
 - The dynamical system view
 - The connectivity (adjacency matrix) view

## Interventions in causal identification

## Understanding identification through derived properties of circuits (reachability rules)



# Results

## Case Study: Applying <CLINC> to distinguish a pair of circuits

# (back to methods?)

## Characterizing circuit-pair ambiguity through reachability properties, as a function of circuit size

## Reachability
- ( what is it, how do we calculate it )
- ( concept of it as a "best case scenario" for identification. i.e. quantities of circuit properties could make identification worse than what would be predicted from reachability alone )

## Characterization

- Pipeline for inferring circuits with intervention
- Relevant properties of spiking circuits
- Parameters of intervention
- Methods for extracting circuit estimates
- Quantifying successful identification

# Discussion
- Limitations
- Comparison to related work
