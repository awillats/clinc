# Top 3 highest priority writing / planning tasks:
- [ ] draft abstract 
  - [x] review matt's draft - @awillats
  - [x] review abstracts from similar papers to assess scope, style - @awillats
  - [x] resketch outline, key points @awillats
  - [.] add section for expected results @awillats
  - [ ] fill text for new sections @awillats , @matthewoshaughnessy
  - [ ] review @awillats @matthewoshaughnessy

- [ ] draft statement of need 
  - [.] review suggestions for this from Chris
  - [ ] describe intersection of several fields (CL, causal, network neuro)
  - [x] describe context of similar papers
  - [ ] highlight unique aspect of this work

- [ ] sketch core figures 

# planning tasks 
- evaluate scope, potentially combine / cut figures
- how much should this be a perspective / review / prospectus 
  - v.s. focusing on new empricial research results
- decide flow between 
  - params (weight, delay)
  - intervention 
- possible journals 
  - perspectives 
    - Nature Neuro
  - technical
    - PLOS Comp Bio
    - JNE 

# intro / methods tasks
 - [ ] add more closed-loop references to intro[^ctrl_sys_id]
  - 
 - Describe the methods for identifying circuits[^FC_measures][^connect_infer]
  - xcorr procedure 
  - IDTxl recap 
    - cover multivariate transfer entropy 
 - evaluate dimensions of parameter sweeps[^FC_measures]
 - sketch a short review of closed-loop in neuro
  - Grosenick/Deisseroth, Kording 
  
 - [~] write up "tutorial" + latex for different ways of representing a circuit

 [^FC_measures]: "A systematic framework for functional connectivity measures" includes a broad comparison of performance of Granger causality vs transfer entropy vs other methods. also discusses role of weights, noise
 [^connect_infer]: "Connectivity inference from neural recording data: Challenges, mathematical bases and research directions"
 [^ctrl_sys_id]: "A control-theoretic system identification framework and a real-time closed-loop clinical simulation testbed for electrical brain stimulation"

# theory 
- [ ] relate noise â†’ connection SNR to sensitivity transfer function 
  - see [Astrom feedback fundamentals](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/courses/cds101/fa02/caltech/astrom-ch5.pdf)
- [ ] copy over notation from 2020 brainstorming [overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e8232cd6157d200014b52d4)
  - rules for identifiability 
- [ ] discuss the role of prior anatomical knowledge in reducing search space 

# formatting tasks 
- add figure references to table of contents  

# organization tasks
- move exemplars to sketches/intro-background ?
