# minor tasks 
# Organization considerations 
- [ ] should representations and reachability live under predicting correlation structure?
  - R&R shows up multiple places, hard to know where to hit the concept hard, and whether to do that all in one place

# Technical loose-ends 
- [ ] summarizing relationship between intervention utility (across-hypoth entropy) and circuit properties
