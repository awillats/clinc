# Top 3 highest priority writing tasks:

- [~] re-arrange sections 
  - [x] scan as-is 
    - minimally filtered two-column pdf
  - [x] verify flow against examples
    - see /planning/__local/exemplar_section_structures.md
    
  - [~] make prior arrangement changes (to outline)
    - see writing tasks 
    - discussion to set order of certain subsections
    - [x] new outline?  
    
  - [x] make intro-results changes (to outline)
  - [~] compartmentalize sections so they can be moved flexibly 
    - [ ] impact of intervention section needs splitting in two
    
  - [~] move sections to new outline ðŸŽ¯
    - `outline to imports script?`
    - [ ] new sections as needed from outline
    - [[ ]] overall, big task will be writing results-flavored versions of key methods sections 
      - light on notation
    
  
- [ ] fill in content gaps 
  - [ ] fill in results 
  - [ ] identify additional gaps
    - [ ] reevaluate progress.md
    
# minor tasks 
- [ ] cut entropy to it's own chapter, then sink to methods 
- [ ] split results_impact_of_intervention.md
  - [ ] pull variance notes out of Stronger Intervention shapes
  
# Organization considerations 
- [ ] should representations and reachability live under predicting correlation structure?
  - R&R shows up multiple places, hard to know where to hit the concept hard, and whether to do that all in one place

# Technical loose-ends 
- [ ] summarizing relationship between intervention utility (across-hypoth entropy) and circuit properties
