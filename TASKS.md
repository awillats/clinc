# Top 3 highest priority writing tasks:

<details><summary>planning</summary>

  - for now, set aside unresolved technical details 
  - topic sentences for each paragraph
  - how many figures?
  - [.] review outline, check which outline is most up-to-date
    - [~] outline.md
    - [~] workflowy 
      - [text outline](https://beta.workflowy.com/#/232d9f5210ee)
        - includes some takeaway points
      - [figure plan board](https://beta.workflowy.com/#/60a88f9b8aaa)
  - for now, we're splitting sections based on simulations, theory, summary rather than traditional methods, results
    - reevaluate later
</details>


- [x] high level review of scope and completeness
  - what to focus on this week
  - [ ] compare length, figure count to target papers
- [~] review, update methods outlines
- [ ]  ⚠️ automatic writing session - methods - @matt, @adam
  

----

- [~] table of closed-loop advantages
  - [ ] which ones are we demonstrating here

# Technical loose-ends 
- [ ] summarizing relationship between intervention utility (across-hypoth entropy) and circuit properties
- [ ] ⚠️ predicting time-lagged correlation 
- [ ] quantitative match between gaussian sims & theory [~]

# minor tasks 
@ matt - causal notation for open-loop inputs? 
  - how would you write x = x + u_OL ? - see [causal_vs_expt.md](sketches_and_notation/intro-background/causal_vs_expt.md)
