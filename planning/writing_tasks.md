Word count:

# Organization / structure / flow 
- [ ] where does methods pipeline figure go?
- [ ] integrate _steps_of_inference.md as overview at the end of intro
  - [ ] also use steps as sections of methods overview
  - [ ] merge more detailed content into sections of methods overview
  - [ ] ? create hypotheses-set-focused methods overview figure ?
    - current figure really focuses on the fate of one circuit at a time

- [ ] split sim methods elsewhere
    - [ ] pull all into theory / methods overview section
    - [ ] 4.1.2 - time-resolvable goes in discussion?
    - [ ] 4.3 - merge "estimating circuits" into inference pipeline steps
    - [ ] 4.4 - info theoretic measures could simply be combined with results section
- [ ] Tentatively, bump 2.3 into theory section

# Writing 

- [ ] (in background-interventions) get language more precise and effective about value of intervention
  - ([Adam:] revisit related work, try to distill down our core argument about why intervention > passive observation) 
  - Reframe $x \to y$ vs $x \leftarrow y$ argument to focus on distinguishing between members of a hypotheses set (hypothesis first, data second) 
  - Add example demonstrating why location of stimulation matters to "The inferential power of interventions..." paragraphs 
  - [Matt:] editing pass on last paragraph, qualify last paragraph (lean toward 'we are starting simple, blazing a trail for future research')

- [ ] Describe what 'reachability' is (we're interested in net directional impact of one node on another, which includes both effects from direct and indirect connections) 


# Mechanical
- [ ] deemphasize / soften language around "tools for causality"
  - really bringing in ideas from causality, but not using formal tools
- [ ] flip matrix convention 
  - use dynamical system throughout
    - live with $W_{j‚Üíi} = W[i,j]$
- [ ] Rewrite X=XW+E as vector version (and resolve contemporaneous setting in methods>simulation section) 

- [ ] (in background) Talk about what 'reachability' means (total direct+indirect impact) 
- [ ] [Matt:] (in background) Rewrite first paragraph to not use notation (place this box before any theory/notation sections) 
- [ ] [Matt:] Set expectation here that we're talking about linear Gaussian circuits

    - [ ] check context-content-conclusion structure
    - [ ] diagram out threads of logic ‚Üí should be as serial as possible
      - avoid "why was i told that?" (missing context) and "so what?" (missing conclusion)
        - ask yourself these questions to emulate a naive reader
        
      - in intro, check for
        - Ans: why does the paper matter? 
        - connection to big problem in science
        - statement of what the field knows 
        - refinement to narrow paper gap
        - summary of our approach, our results
          - shouldn't restate context 
          - shouldn't preview conclusion (much)
      - in results check for 
        - METHODS SUMMARY (high-level): FIRST, what question are we trying to answer
          - then OVERVIEW of methods (pipeline summary)
          - basic components
          - answer we're looking for
          - overall approach
          - key innovative methods
          - assume readers aren't going to pore over the details
          
        - RESULTS:
          - [ ] what are the sequence of statements we're trying to prove? ‚Üí turn these into headers
            - support these steps with figures
            - connect these steps to final conclusion
          - [ ] verify paragraphs start with "to verify that..." "we tested whether..."
          - [ ] verify paragraphs end with answer to question
          - [ ] verify each title states a conclusion
          - [ ] verify each legend tells how the trick was done
          - ( ) use my highlight color-code to check for context-content-conclusion?

          - need to show
          - how? by doing x
