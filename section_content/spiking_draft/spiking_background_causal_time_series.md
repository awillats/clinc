**Inferring causal interactions from time series.** A number of strategies have been proposed to detect causal relationships between observed variables. Wiener-Granger (or predictive) causality states that a variable $X$ "Granger-causes" $Y$ if $X$ contains information relevant to $Y$ that is not contained in $Y$ itself or any other variable [@wiener1956theory]. This concept has traditionally been operationalized with vector autoregressive models [@granger1969investigating]; the requirement that *all* potentially causative variables be considered makes these notions of dependence susceptible to unobserved confounders [@runge2018causal].

[^SCOPE-background]: TODO: need to assess total scope, cut or diminish reference to time-lagged correlations if it doesn't make it to final paper

`Our work initially focuses on measures of directional interaction that are based on lagged correlations[^SCOPE-background] [@melssen1987detection].` These metrics look at the correlation of time series collected from pairs of nodes at various lags and detect peaks at negative time lags. Such peaks could indicate the presence of a direct causal relationship -- but they could also stem from indirect causal links or hidden confounders [@dean2016dangers]. In these bivariate correlation methods, it is thus necessary to consider patterns of correlation between many pairs of nodes in order to differentiate between direct, indirect, and confounding relationships [@dean2016dangers]. This distinguishes these strategies from some multivariate methods that "control" for the effects of potential confounders. While cross-correlation-based measures are generally limited to detecting linear functional relationships between nodes, their computational feasibility makes them a frequent metric of choice in experimental neuroscience work [@knox1981detection; @salinas2001correlated; @garofalo2009evaluation].

Other techniques detect directional interaction stemming from more general or complex relationships. Information-theoretic methods, which use information-based measures to assess the reduction in entropy knowledge of one variable provides about another, are closely related to Granger causality [@schreiber2000measuring; @barnett2009granger]. The *transfer entropy* $T_{X \to Y}(t) = I(Y_t \colon X_{<t} \mid Y_{<t})$ extends this notion to time series by measuring the amount of information present in $Y_t$ that is not contained in the past of either $X$ or $Y$ (denoted $X_{<t}$ and $Y_{<t}$) [@bossomaier2016transfer]. Using transfer entropy as a measure of causal interaction requires accounting for potential confounding variables; the *conditional transfer entropy* $T_{X \to Y \mid Z}(t) = I(Y_t \colon X_{<t} \mid Y_{<t}, Z_{<t})$ conditions on the past of other variables to account for their potential confounding influence `Sec.~4.2.3` [@bossomaier2016transfer]. Conditional transfer entropy can thus be interpreted as the amount of information present in $Y$ that is not contained in the past of $X$, the past of $Y$, or the past of other variables $Z$.

To quantify the strength of causal interactions, information-theoretic and transfer-entropy-based methods typically require knowledge of the ground truth causal relationships that exist [@janzing2013quantifying] or an ability to perturb the system [@ay2008information; @lizier2010differentiating]. In practice, these quantities are typically interpreted as "information transfer," and a variety of estimation strategies and methods to automatically select the conditioning set (i.e., the variables and time lags that should be conditioned on) are used (e.g., [@shorten2021estimating]). Multivariate conditional transfer entropy approaches using various variable selection schemes can differentiate between direct interactions, indirect interactions, and common causes, but their results depend on choices such as the binning strategies used to discretize continuous signals, the specific statistical tests used, and the estimator used to compute transfer entropy [@wibral2014directed]. `[If we end up making the jump to IDTxl in our results: In our empirical results using transfer-entropy-based notions of directional influence we use the IDTxl toolbox [@wollstadt2019idtxl].]` However, despite their mathematical differences, previous work has found that cross-correlation-based metrics and information-based metrics tend to produce qualitatively similar results, with similar patterns of true and false positives [@garofalo2009evaluation].
