**Why does closed-loop control provide a categorical advantage?** Because it severs indirect links

`this is has to be backed up by aggregate results:`
- this is especially relevant in recurrently connected networks where the reachability matrix becomes more dense. 
- more stuff is connected to other stuff, so there are more indirect connections, and the resulting correlations look more similar (more circuits in the equivalence class)
- patterns of correlation become more specific with increasing intervention strength 
  - more severed links â†’ more unique adjacency-specific patterns of correlation

### Stronger intervention shapes correlation, resulting in more data-efficient inference with less bias

!!!! - Explain why closed-loop helps - bidirectional variance control - 40% done
[^dof]: need a more specific way of stating this. I mean degrees of freedom in the sense that mean and variance can be controlled independent of each other. And also, that the range of achievable correlation coefficients is wider for closed-loop than open-loop (where instrinsic variability constrains the minimum output variance)
  
[^intrinsic_var]: below the level set by added, independent/"private" sources
  
While a primary advantage of closed-loop interventions for circuit inference is its ability to functionally lesion indirect connections, another, more nuanced `(quantitative)` advantage of closed-loop control lies in its capacity to bidirectionally control output variance. While the variance of an open-loop stimulus can be titrated to adjust the output variance at a node, in general, an open-loop stimulus cannot reduce this variance below its instrinsic[^intrinsic_var] variability. That is, if the system is linear with gaussian noise,
$$\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{open},\sigma^2_S) \geq \mathbb{V}_{i}(C)$$
More specifically, if the open-loop stimulus is statistically independent from the intrinsic variability[^open_loop_independent]
$$\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{open},\sigma^2_S) = \mathbb{V}_{i}(C) + \sigma^2_S$$
Applying closed-loop to a linear gaussian circuit:

\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{closed},\sigma^2_S) &= \sigma^2_S \\
\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{closed},\sigma^2_S) &\perp \mathbb{V}_{i}(C)
\end{align}
\]

<details><summary> â†ª Firing rates couple mean and variance </summary> 

In neural circuits, we're often interested in firing rates, which are non-negative. This particular output nonlinearity means that the linear gaussian assumptions do not hold, especially in the presence of strong inhibitory inputs. In this setting, firing rate variability is coupled to its mean rate; Under a homoeneous-rate Poisson assumption, mean firing rate and firing rate variability would be proportional. With inhibitory inputs, open-loop stimulus can drive firing rates low enough to reduce their variability. Here, feedback control still provides an advantage in being able to control the mean and variance of firing rates independently[^cl_indp_practical]


\[
\begin{align}
\mu^{out}_i &= f(\mu^{in}_i, \mathbb{V}^{in}_i)\\
\mathbb{V}^{out}_{i}(C) &= f(\mu^{out}_i, \mathbb{V}^{in}_i)
\end{align}
\]

`Ideal control`
\[
\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{closed},\sigma^2_S) = \sigma^2_S 
\]
`Imperfect control` - intuitively feedback control is counteracting / subtracting disturbance due to unobserved sources, including intrinsic variability. We could summarize the effectiveness of closed-loop disturbance rejection with a scalar $0\leq\gamma\leq1$
\[
\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{closed},\sigma^2_S) = \mathbb{V}_{i}(C) - \gamma\mathbb{V}_{i}(C) + \sigma^2_S \\
\mathbb{V}_{i}(C|S=\text{closed},\sigma^2_S) = (1-\gamma) \mathbb{V}_{i}(C) + \sigma^2_S
\]

[^open_loop_independent]: notably, this is part of the definition of open-loop intervention
[^cl_indp_practical]: practically, this requires very fast feedback to achieve fully independent control over mean and variance. In the case of firing rates, I suspect $\mu \leq \alpha\mathbb{V}$, so variances can be reduced, but for very low firing rates, there's still an upper limit on what the variance can be.

We have shown that closed-loop interventions provide more flexible control over output variance of nodes in a network, and that shared and independent sources of variance determine pairwise correlations between node outputs. Together, this suggests closed-loop interventions may allow us to shape the pattern of correlations with more degrees of freedom[^dof] `[why do we want to?...]`

One application of this increased flexibility [...] is to increase correlations associated with pairs of directly correlated nodes, while decreasing spurious correlations associated with pairs of nodes without a direct connection (but perhaps are influenced by a common input, or are connected only indirectly). This manipulation may bring the observed pattern of correlations  

Our hypothesis is that this shaping of pairwise correlations will result in reduced false positive edges in inferred circuits, "unblurring" the indirect associations that would otherwise confound circuit inference. However care must be taken, as this strategy relies on a hypothesis for the ground truth adjacency and may also result in a "confirmation bias" as new spurious correlations can be introduced through closed-loop intervention.

The impact of intervention on correlations can be summarized through the co-reachability $\text{CoReach}(i,j|S_k)$. A useful distillation of this mapping is to understand the sign of $\frac{dR_{ij}}{dS_k}$, that is whether increasing the variance of an intervention at node $k$ increases or decreases the correlation between nodes $i$ and $j$

In a simulated network Aâ†’B [(fig. variance)](#fig-var) we demonstrate predicted and emprirical correlations between a pair of nodes as a function of intervention type, location, and variance. A few features are present which provide a general intuition for the impact of intervention location in larger circuits: First, interventions "upstream" of a true connection [(lower left, fig. variance)](#fig-var) tend to increase the connection-related variance, and therefore strengthen the observed correlations.
$$\text{Reach}(S_kâ†’i) \neq 0 \\ \text{Reach}(iâ†’j) \neq 0 \\ \frac{dR}{dS_k} > 0$$

Second, interventions affecting only the downstream node [(lower right, fig. variance)](#fig-var) of a true connection introduce variance which is independent of the connection Aâ†’B, decreasing the observed correlation.
$$\text{Reach}(S_k â†’ j) = 0 \\ \text{Reach}(S_k â†’ j) \neq 0 \\ \frac{dR}{dS_k} < 0$$

Third, interventions which reach both nodes will tend to increase the observed correlations [(upper left, fig. variance)](#fig-var), moreover this can be achieved even if no direct connection $iâ†’j$ exists.
$$\text{Reach}(S_k â†’ i) \neq 0 \\ \text{Reach}(S_k â†’ j) \neq 0 \\ \text{Reach}(i â†’ j) = 0 \\ \frac{dR}{dS_k} > 0$$

Notably, the impact of an intervention which is a "common cause" for both nodes depends on the relative weighted reachability between the source and each of the nodes. Correlations induced by a common cause are maximized when the input to each node is equal, that is $\widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’i} \approx \widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’j}$ (upper right * in [fig. variance](#fig-var)). If iâ†’j are connected $\widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’i} \gg \widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’j}$ results in an variance-correlation relationship similar to the "upstream source" case (increasing source variance increases correlation $\frac{dR}{dS_k} > 0$),
 while $\widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’i} \ll \widetilde{W}_{S_kâ†’j}$ results in a relationship similar to the "downstream source" case ($\frac{dR}{dS_k} < 0$)[^verify_drds]

[^verify_drds]: not 100% sure this is true, the empirical results are really pointing to dR/dW<0 rather than dR/dS<0

The change in correlation as a function of changing intervention variance ($\frac{dR_{ij}}{dS}$) can therefore be used as an additional indicator of presence/absence and directionality of the connection between A,B
ðŸš§
#### Impact of intervention location and variance on pariwise correlations
[Fig. variance](#fig-var) also demonstrates the relative dynamic range of correlations achievable under passive, open- and closed-loop intervention. In the passive case, correlations are determined by instrinsic properties of the network. These properties have influence over the observed correlations in a way that can be difficult to separate from differences due to the ground-truth circuit. With open-loop intervention we can observe the impact of increasing variance at a particular node, but the dynamic range of achievable correlations is bounded by not being able to reduce variance below its baseline level. With closed-loop control, the bidirectional control of the output variance for a node means a much wider range of correlations can be achieved [(blue v.s. orange in fig. variance)](#fig-var), resulting in a more sensitive signal reflecting the ground-truth connectivity.
