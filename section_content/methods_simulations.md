<!-- ## Modeling network structure and dynamics -->

`WORK IN PROGRESS`


We sought to understand both general principles (abstracted across particulars of network implementation) as well as some practical considerations introduced by dealing with spikes and synapses. We simulate a network of nodes with Gaussian noise sources, linear interactions, and linear dynamics.
