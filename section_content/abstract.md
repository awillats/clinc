<!-- ## Short version
A primary goal of neuroscience is identifying causal relationships in the brain, a task often aided by interventions which stimulate activity in portions of the brain such as lesioning and optogenetics. These open-loop interventions, however, do not fully eliminate potential confounding influences, often limiting their ability to reveal causal structure. 

In this paper, we use tools from causal inference, control theory, and neuroscience to show *when* and *how* closed-loo interventions can more effectively reveal causal relationships. Using a variety of simulated neural circuits, we examine how key process and intervention parameters affect identifiability, developing guidance to help experimentalists determine when closed-loop control is needed to infer causal structure, and when observational data or open-loop stimulation is sufficient. Our results build toward a practical framework that will aid experimental neuroscientists design and interpret experiments that, by revealing more causal structure in the brain, could open the door to new and more effective therapies.

## Abstract
The necessity of intervention in inferring cause has long been understood in neuroscience. Recent work has highlighted the limitations of passive observation and single-site lesion studies in accurately recovering causal circuit structure. The advent of optogenetics has facilitated increasingly precise forms of intervention including closed-loop control which may help eliminate confounding influences. However, it is not yet clear how best to apply closed-loop control to leverage this increased inferential power. In this paper, we use tools from causal inference, control theory, and neuroscience to show *when* and *how* closed-loop interventions can more effectively reveal causal relationships. We also examine the performance of standard network inference procedures in simulated spiking networks under passive, open-loop and closed-loop conditions. We demonstrate a unique capacity of feedback control to distinguish competing circuit hypotheses by disrupting connections which would otherwise result in equivalent patterns of correlation. Our results build toward a practical framework to improve design of neuroscience experiments to answer causal questions about neural circuits.

The necessity of intervention (e.g. stimulation, lesion experiments) in inferring cause has long been understood in neuroscience. Recent work has highlighted the importance of a causal perspective in answering questions about network structure and function[^pearl][^advance][^quasi]. It is increasingly clear that recording from more of the brain and using sophisticated inference approaches is necessary but not sufficient to understand how the brain functions[^fiete]. Indeed, it has been shown that open-loop stimulation and single-site lesioning experiments may also be insufficient [^promise][^lepperod][^jonas][^fakhar]. In tandem, the advent of optogenetics has facilitated increasingly precise and useful forms of intervention including closed-loop control[^grosenick] - a form of stimulation which adapts inputs in response to measured activity and which shows promise in overcoming limitations of other interventions.
<!-- gap, remaining challenges -->
However, the potential of closed-loop stimulation for network inference has not yet been achieved. A major challenge remains in integrating established techniques from control theory, causal inferences, and design of experiments in neuroscience. It is not yet clear how best to design the particulars of closed-loop control to leverage the increased inferential power granted by these approaches.
<!-- new expected results section -->
Here, we attempt to lay out these complementary ideas from causal inference and control theory in a unified description, with the goal of discovering how and where closed-loop interventions are best applied. In support of this aim, we demonstrate the performance of standard network inference procedures in simulated spiking networks under passive, open-loop and closed-loop conditions. This investigation reveals general principles of how intervention interacts with circuit structure to shape the pattern of dependence across groups. In particular, we demonstrate a unique capacity of feedback control to distinguish competing circuit hypotheses by disrupting connections which would otherwise result in equivalent patterns of correlation.
<!-- significance -->
This work continues the conversation around seeking causal answers to questions of how the brain functions and how best to use the tools at our disposal. We hope it aids those designing experiments in choosing how and where to apply stimulation in order to efficiently distinguish between competing hypotheses.
