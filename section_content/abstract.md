The necessity of intervention in inferring cause has long been understood in neuroscience. Recent work has highlighted the limitations of passive observation and single-site lesion studies in accurately recovering causal circuit structure. The advent of optogenetics has facilitated increasingly precise forms of intervention including closed-loop control which may help eliminate confounding influences. However, it is not yet clear how best to apply closed-loop control to leverage this increased inferential power. In this paper, we use tools from causal inference, control theory, and neuroscience to show when and how closed-loop interventions can more effectively reveal causal relationships. We also examine the performance of standard network inference procedures in simulated spiking networks under passive, open-loop and closed-loop conditions. We demonstrate a unique capacity of feedback control to distinguish competing circuit hypotheses by disrupting connections which would otherwise result in equivalent patterns of correlation[^bidir]. Our results build toward a practical framework to improve design of neuroscience experiments to answer causal questions about neural circuits.
