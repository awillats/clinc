- core idea is that "stronger" interventions lead to "higher inferential power"
  - may mean identifying circuits with less data 
  - but may also mean distinguishing circuits which may have been "observationally equivalent" under weaker interventions 
- **Highlight that the impact of interventions may generalize across any particular choice of inference algorithm**
- different effect of intervention types
