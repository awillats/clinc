### Stronger intervention shapes correlation, resulting in more data-efficient inference with less bias

<!-- NOTE: - Explain why closed-loop helps - bidirectional variance control - 60% done -->

[^dof]: need a more specific way of stating this. I mean degrees of freedom in the sense that mean and variance can be controlled independent of each other. And also, that the range of achievable correlation coefficients is wider for closed-loop than open-loop (where instrinsic variability constrains the minimum output variance)
  
[^intrinsic_var]: below the level set by added, independent/"private" sources
  
While a primary advantage of closed-loop interventions for circuit inference is its ability to functionally lesion indirect connections, another, more nuanced `(quantitative)` advantage of closed-loop control lies in its capacity to bidirectionally control output variance. While the variance of an open-loop stimulus can be titrated to adjust the output variance at a node, in general, an open-loop stimulus cannot reduce this variance below its instrinsic[^intrinsic_var] variability. That is, if the system is linear with Gaussian noise,`...`

We have shown that closed-loop interventions provide more flexible control over output variance of nodes in a network, and that shared and independent sources of variance determine pairwise correlations between node outputs. Together, this suggests closed-loop interventions may allow us to shape the pattern of correlations with more degrees of freedom[^dof] `[why do we want to?...]`

One application of this increased flexibility is to increase correlations associated with pairs of directly correlated nodes, while decreasing spurious correlations associated with pairs of nodes without a direct connection (but perhaps are influenced by a common input, or are connected only indirectly). While "correlation does not imply causation," intervention may decrease the gap between the two. 

Our hypothesis is that this shaping of pairwise correlations will result in reduced false positive edges in inferred circuits, "unblurring" the indirect associations that would otherwise confound circuit inference. However care must be taken, as this strategy relies on a hypothesis for the ground truth adjacency and may also result in a "confirmation bias" as new spurious correlations can be introduced through closed-loop intervention.

> **(CENTER)** A two-node linear Gaussian network is simulated with a connection from A→B. Open-loop interventions *(blue)* consist of independent Gaussian inputs with a range of variances $\sigma^2_S$. Closed-loop interventions *(orange)* consist of feedback control with an independent Gaussian target with a range of variances. *Incomplete closed-loop interventions result in node outputs which are a mix of the control target and network-driven activity*. Connections from sources to nodes are colored by their impact on correlations between A and B; green denotes $dR/dS > 0$, red denotes $dR/dS<0$.
> **(lower left)** Intervention "upstream" of the connection A→B increases the correlation $r^2(A,B)$.
> **(lower right)** Intervention at the terminal of the connection A→B decreases the correlation $r^2(A,B)$ by adding connection-independent noise.
> **(upper left)** Intervention with shared inputs to both nodes generally increases $r^2(A,B)$, *(even without A→B, see supplement)*.
> **(upper right)** The impact of shared interventions depends on relative weighted reachability $\text{Reach}(S_k→A) / \text{Reach}(S_k→B)$, with highest correlations when these terms are matched (see *)
> Closed-loop interventions *(orange)* generally result in larger changes in correlation across $\sigma^2_S$ than the equivalent open-loop intervention. Closed-loop control at B effectively lesions the connection A→B, resulting in near-zero correlation.

🚧
The change in correlation as a function of changing intervention variance ($\frac{dr^2_{ij}}{dS}$) can therefore be used as an additional indicator of presence/absence and directionality of the connection between A,B *(see [fig. disambig. D.)](fig-disambig))*
🚧


[Fig. variance](#fig-var) also demonstrates the relative dynamic range of correlations achievable under passive, open- and closed-loop intervention. In the passive case, correlations are determined by instrinsic properties of the network $\sigma^2_{base}$. These properties have influence over the observed correlations in a way that can be difficult to separate from differences due to the ground-truth circuit. With open-loop intervention we can observe the impact of increasing variance at a particular node, but the dynamic range of achievable correlations is bounded by not being able to reduce variance below its baseline level. With closed-loop control, the bidirectional control of the output variance for a node means a much wider range of correlations can be achieved [(blue v.s. orange in fig. variance)](#fig-var), resulting in a more sensitive signal reflecting the ground-truth connectivity.

<!-- - [super minor] First part of fig DISAMBIG: subsections (A) through (C) work really well
- [super minor] in caption for (D-F): "modifications to the passive correlation pattern" is a bit confusing in the context of open-loop intervention
- [super minor] also in caption for (D-F): really like "intervention-specific fingerprint" terminology. The last sentence of the (D-F) caption really hits the message home, possible to emphasize that this is the take-home message earlier?
- [narrative/organization] fig DISAMBIG feels really example-y, more like a proof of concept than 'results.' The writing in Sec 5.1.1 also has this flavor, like it could be in a methods section. (The plot in the top right feels much more results-ey.) Not necessarily a bad thing, maybe just a consideration for thinking about article vs perspective flavor. -->

- [missing] Section 5.1.2.1: what are the definitions of S_k, CoReach(i,j|S_k), and R_{ij}?
- [narrative] Section 5.1.2.1: the narrative here really works for me, but it's a little unclear whether this is more of a 'result' or a 'recipe' -- the figures here also feel more example/proof-of-concept-ey, and the math here helps ground things in
- [missing] discussion of partial closed-loop control?
