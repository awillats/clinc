- *(walkthrough from passive, open-loop, closed-loop with historic examples)*
  - **passive** detect seizure from EEG 
  - **open-loop** Penfield discovers spatial map of senses by electrical stimulation 
  - **lesion studies** in neuro
    - disadvantages of lesioning
  - **closed-loop** Hodgkin, Huxley discover the role of ion channels in generating action potentials through voltage clamp
  - What is closed-loop control?
      - Responsive and per-sample feedback control in neuro
      - Comparison to standard neuro system identification procedures (stim, lesions)
      - Stanley, Rozell prior work in closed-loop opto
