Many hypotheses about neural circuits are phrased in terms of causal relationships: "will changes in activity to this region of the brain produce corresponding changes in another region?" Understanding these causal relationships is critical to both scientific understanding and to developing effective therapeutic interventions, which require knowledge of how potential therapies will impact brain activity and patient outcomes.
