!!!! - Explain why closed-loop helps - more data efficient - 10% done



> - less data required to get to threshold level of accuracy (more data-efficient)
>      - likely comes from improved "SNR" which can be thought of as a derived property of the per-edge correlations

!!!! - Explain why closed-loop helps - less bias - 5% done
> - higher infinite-data accuracy (i.e. less bias)
>    - lower bias likely comes from the categorical advantages above
> - breakdown false positives, false negatives
